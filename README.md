# MSPA To Go

MSPA To Go is a webserver that serves pages from MS Paint Adventures in a format
digestible on mobile phones. With the redirection of the original MS Paint Adventures
site to the VIZ Media-run site, and the VIZ Media site's constant HTTP 500 errors, there
is no good way to read MSPA on mobile. At least there wasn't until now!

MS Paint Adventures is the work of Andrew Hussie, and I am not associated with MS Paint Adventures,
What Pumpkin, VIZ Media, or the Homestuck Independent Creative Union. MSPA To Go is made out of love
for MSPA and a desire for it to be accessible to those using mobile devices.
