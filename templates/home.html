        MSPA To Go is an application server that serves pages from MS Paint Adventures in a format
        digestible on mobile phones. With the original MS Paint Adventures site being discontinued,
        and the VIZ Media-run site being incredibly broken, there is no good way to read MSPA on mobile.
        At least there wasn't until now!
        <br><br>
        Not familiar with MSPA page numbers? VIZ page numbers will redirect you to the right MSPA
        page! For example, /homestuck/1 will take you to /read/6/001901.
        <br><br>
        MS Paint Adventures is the work of Andrew Hussie, and this website's operator nor the author of the project (aubymori)
        are associated with MS Paint Adventures, What Pumpkin, VIZ Media, or the Homestuck Independent Creative Union. MSPA To Go
        is made out of love for MSPA and a desire for it to be accessible to those using mobile devices.
