        As many of you know, the folks over at <a href="https://homestuck.com/" target="_blank">Homestuck.com</a>
        have begun slowly releasing a complete rewrite of the site as of today. I will be trying
        out the site extensively as updates get pushed out, and I will relay my feedback to the
        developers of the site in the
        <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hsofficial" target="_blank">official Homestuck discord server</a>.
        <br><br>
        My eventual goal is for MSPA To Go to no longer be needed for most cases, and maybe
        to stop providing a public instance. MSPA To Go will not go away forever, however. I am already
        working to make my own local archive of the files from the MSPA server that MSPA To Go needs,
        should mspaintadventures.com be stripped of its comic content. I made the tools to download
        needed files and use them on an instance of MSPA To Go months ago, when a friend needed it for
        an airplane trip.
        <br><br>
        If this is in fact the end, then I want to thank all of you. Thank you for using my site that
        I originally made only to read Homestuck at school. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to
        make a forever impact on the Homestuck and MSPA community. Thank you for reporting bugs and issues
        so that I can provide the best, most polished reading experience for desktop and mobile devices.
        <br><br>

        This update just adds fancy text for the embeds instead of the generic text
        for every page. Hope you enjoy!

        I'm not sure why I hadn't done this earlier. Previously, I simply showed off updates through
        Twitter, but obviously, not everyone has Twitter. Any new updates will go here along with a
        short Tweet telling people to check the News page to see the changelog.
        <br><br>
        Other than the news page, this update fixes a bug that caused certain cookies to expire just
        around 9 hours after their creation.
        <br><br>
        Despite making MSPA To Go months ago and using it to read then, I don't believe I had ever
        actually extensively used the Save/Load Game features (which were affected by this bug)
        until very recently. My school has those shitty Yondr pouches this year, and I am confined
        to using just the school Chromebook, so I've been reading Problem Sleuth using MSPA To Go
        while bored in class. At first, I thought the bug was the shitty school-enrolled Chromebooks
        wiping their cookies after a while, but using other sites made me realize it wasn't that.
        <br><br>
        So now we are here. I have fixed this incredibly inconvenient bug that slipped past me all
        these months, simply because I had assumed that JavaScript date functions used seconds and 
        not milliseconds.
