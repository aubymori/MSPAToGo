        If you look at <a href="https://linktr.ee/andrewhussie" target="_blank">Andrew Hussie's Linktree</a>,
        you will notice that MSPA To Go is now linked there! If you're coming from there, welcome, and have a good
        time on this site! The unfathomable amount of traffic to this site along with the huge amount of people
        sharing it and recommending it to their friends was enough to make me go crazy. Being shared and endorsed
        by Andrew Hussie himself is on a completely different level. Thank all of you for your usage of this site
        and support over the past 5 months. It was a lot of fun making this site, fixing bugs, and adding new features.
        Your support means everything to me.
        <br><br>
        Love, Aubrey &lt;3

        As many of you know, the folks over at <a href="https://homestuck.com/" target="_blank">Homestuck.com</a>
        have begun slowly releasing a complete rewrite of the site as of today. I will be trying
        out the site extensively as updates get pushed out, and I will relay my feedback to the
        developers of the site in the
        <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hsofficial" target="_blank">official Homestuck discord server</a>.
        <br><br>
        My eventual goal is for MSPA To Go to no longer be needed for most cases, and maybe
        to stop providing a public instance. MSPA To Go will not go away forever, however. I am already
        working to make my own local archive of the files from the MSPA server that MSPA To Go needs,
        should mspaintadventures.com be stripped of its comic content. I made the tools to download
        needed files and use them on an instance of MSPA To Go months ago, when a friend needed it for
        an airplane trip.
        <br><br>
        If this is in fact the end, then I want to thank all of you. Thank you for using my site that
        I originally made only to read Homestuck at school. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to
        make a forever impact on the Homestuck and MSPA community. Thank you for reporting bugs and issues
        so that I can provide the best, most polished reading experience for desktop and mobile devices.
        <br><br>
        - Aubrey

        This update just adds fancy text for the embeds instead of the generic text

        I'm not sure why I hadn't done this earlier. Previously, I simply showed off updates through
        Twitter, but obviously, not everyone has Twitter. Any new updates will go here along with a
        short Tweet telling people to check the News page to see the changelog.
        <br><br>
        Other than the news page, this update fixes a bug that caused certain cookies to expire just
        around 9 hours after their creation.
        <br><br>
        Despite making MSPA To Go months ago and using it to read then, I don't believe I had ever
        actually extensively used the Save/Load Game features (which were affected by this bug)
        until very recently. My school has those shitty Yondr pouches this year, and I am confined
        to using just the school Chromebook, so I've been reading Problem Sleuth using MSPA To Go
        while bored in class. At first, I thought the bug was the shitty school-enrolled Chromebooks
        wiping their cookies after a while, but using other sites made me realize it wasn't that.
        <br><br>
        So now we are here. I have fixed this incredibly inconvenient bug that slipped past me all
        these months, simply because I had assumed that JavaScript date functions used seconds and 
        not milliseconds.
